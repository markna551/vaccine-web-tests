### Which do you think is a better framework for E2E testing of web applications or web services:  Robot Framework or Cucumber with Selenium/HTTP library and JUnit?

In my opinion Robot Framework is a good framework for testing web applications because it is easier to use, easier to learn and more flexible to test than Cucumber.
